Just a few tips on using github
Just a few tips on using github
## 

          TO CREATE A REPOSITORY
Navigate to the home page of your github account
click the + button and follow the prompts
1. Name
2. Brief description
3. initialize "README"
4. create repo

NEXT 
You have to create a directory for your repo to live in on your local computer.
1. go to git bash
2. $ mkdir name of the directory
3. $ cd new directory
4. $ git init

NEXT
Transfer your repo from github to your new directory on git
1. navigate to the new repo and copy the URL
2. $ git remote add origin paste the url using shift + ins

YOU MAY WANT TO CREATE A FILE AND COPY OR MOVE IT TO YOUR DIRECTORY
Lets call out file "keeps"
Navigate to your new repo on github

click the + button close to the name of your new repo e.g kaykome/kaytest+
name your file and create.
go to github and run:
1. $ touch keeps
2. $ git add .   to add the file
3. $ cp keeps newrepo
4. $ pwd  ## to ensure that you are in the new repo
5. $ ls   ## newrepo keeps will be displayed showing that the new repo contains the file keeps

Now you can go to github and commit your changes to your new file. A master branch is automatically created. since it 
is the first time you are making a commit, you may want to commit directly to the master branch. 
go to git bash and run:
1. $ git checkout -b master ## this switches to the master branch.
go to github
1. Navigate to keeps and click the master branch and then the edit button
2. make your commits
3. click commit changes
go to git bash and run:
1. $ git remote add master
2. $ git push.

NB
.md is used to create a markdown file e.g
Helloworld.md

TO FORK A REPO
Navigate to the repo you intend to fork and click the fork button, go to your github account and navigate to your forked
copy of the repo.
copy the url to your clip board

go to git bash and run:
1. $ git clone paste the url here
 go to github and navigate to the upstream copy of the repo and copy the url
 go back to git bash:
2. $ git remote add upstream paste the url here
3. $ git remote -v  ## to see where your remote is pointing at, here it will point at both the origin and upstream.

NEXT
You have to synchronize your fork to keep it up to date with the upstream repo
go to git bash:
1. $ git fetch upstream
2. $ git checkout master
3. $ git merge upstream/master


TO COMMIT TO A FORKED REPO
first sync with the above commands
go to github and navigate to the file you want to commit to, here lets create a new branch in that file called filess
$ git checkout -b filess
$ git push origin filess
go to github navigate to filess and then make your changes and commit
$ git remote add filess
$ git pull or run the above sync commands
$ git push origin master *** git push origin filess  ### need to clarify this command

TO COMMIT TO A NEW BRANCH ON A REPO YOU CREATED(you may not want to make more changes on your master)
$ git checkout -b files
go to git hub and navigate to filess by typing it in the branch menu
click the edit button and make your changes, commit changes then go to git bash and run:
$ git remote add filess
$ git push
