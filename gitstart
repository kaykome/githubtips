Just a few tips on using github
## 

          TO CREATE A REPOSITORY
Navigate to the home page of your github account
click the + button and follow the prompts
1. Name
2. Brief description
3. initialize "README"
4. create repo

NEXT 
You have to create a directory for your repo to live in on your local computer.
1. go to git bash
2. $ mkdir name of the directory
3. $ cd new directory
4. $ git init

NEXT
Transfer your repo from github to your new directory on git
1. navigate to the new repo and copy the URL
2. $ git remote add origin paste the url using shift + ins

YOU MAY WANT TO CREATE A FILE AND COPY OR MOVE IT TO YOUR DIRECTORY
Lets call out file "keeps"
Navigate to your new repo on github

click the + button close to the name of your new repo e.g kaykome/kaytest+
name your file and create.
go to github and run:
1. $ touch keeps
2. $ git add .   to add the file
3. $ cp keeps newrepo
4. $ pwd  ## to ensure that you are in the new repo
5. $ ls   ## newrepo keeps will be displayed showing that the new repo contains the file keeps

Now you can go to github and commit your changes to your new file. A master branch is automatically created. since it 
is the first time you are making a commit, you may want to commit directly to the master branch. 
go to git bash and run:
1. $ git checkout -b master ## this switches to the master branch.
go to github
1. Navigate to keeps and click the master branch and then the edit button
2. make your commits
3. click commit changes
go to git bash and run:
1. $ git remote add master
2. $ git push.

NB
.md is used to create a markdown file e.g
Helloworld.md
